## Alternative: Override the build in Railway Dashboard

Since the file approach isn't working, let's override it directly in Railway:

1. **Go to your Railway service**
2. **Click on "Settings"** tab
3. **Scroll to "Build" section**
4. **Find "Build Command"** and set it to:
```
   yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```
5. **Find "Install Command"** and set it to:
```
   yarn install --frozen-lockfile
